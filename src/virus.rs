// Create a virus structure that stores information like where the pdb is stored on the current system
// Also tries to gather basic information about the virus
struct Virus {







}

/* Method that converts a vdb to a complete virus object.

    In order to do this, we have to fill in the following information:

    - Name
    - T number
    - family
    - genus
    - atoms per protein
    - everything!!

    I want two different interfaces. One should access the backend json and one should hunt through the html.
    This is a good way to learn.
